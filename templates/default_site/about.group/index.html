		 			<p>At Comprehensive Spine Care we approach all patients with the philosophy that surgery should always be the last resort treatment option.  The surgeons at Comprehensive Spine Care will obtain a thorough history of your symptoms and injuries and personally review all of your diagnostic tests including X-rays, MRI’s, CT scans, and previous treatment recommendation. </p>
		 			 
		 			<p>We believe the majority of spinal conditions can be treated without surgical intervention.  Comprehensive rehabilitation and exercise-based physical therapy play an important role in our non-surgical management of most spinal conditions. Additionally pain management and interventional procedures, such as epidural injections may complement treatment pathways.</p>
		 			 
		 			<p>When all non-surgical treatment options have failed to alleviate our patient’s pain and their quality of life is being adversely impacted, surgery may be recommended.  Our surgeons are experiences in the most contemporary minimally invasive spinal surgery and will develop a surgical plan that is unique and best suited for your specific condition.</p>
